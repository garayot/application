Prompt:

Build a full-stack web-based application to centralize and streamline the Teacher I Application Process based on the UML Activity Diagram and database schema described below.

The system must strictly follow the defined workflow, user roles, and evaluation logic.

🔧 Tech Stack Requirements

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React if supported)

Backend: Node.js with Express

Database: MySQL (or SQLite if MySQL is unavailable on Replit)

Authentication: Session-based or JWT authentication

File Uploads: Multer (for PDF/image document uploads)

👥 User Roles & Access Control

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with three end users:

Applicant (default role: user)

HR Secretariat (default role: admin)

ASDS (default role: admin)

Each role must only access features relevant to their responsibilities.

🧭 Application Workflow (Must Follow UML Activity Diagram)
1️⃣ Applicant Flow

Applicant registers and logs in

Fills in basic personal information

Uploads required documents:

PDS

Application Letters

Certificates (training, eligibility, etc.)

Applies for a specific position

Upon submission:

System generates a unique Applicant_Code

Applicant can track application status

Applicant is not allowed to edit the application once submitted

Applicant receives system notifications for:

Disqualification

Final result

2️⃣ HR Secretariat Flow

View list of submitted applicants

Review uploaded documents

Evaluate Education, Training, and Experience (ETE)

System computes Initial Evaluation Result (IER):

Criteria example:

Level 6 → Bachelor’s Degree holder OR at least 6 units in Master’s Degree

IER Result:

Qualified → Applicant proceeds to assessment stage

Disqualified → Application stops and applicant is notified

For qualified applicants:

Conduct demo teaching

Fill out Initial Evaluation Sheet (IES)

Assess:

Performance

Accomplishments

COI

Class Observation

BEI

System computes Actual Score

3️⃣ System Automation

Automatically compute:

IER qualification result

IES actual score

Generate Comparative Assessment Result (CAR) after IES completion

Enforce process order (no skipping steps)

4️⃣ ASDS Flow

View applicants with completed CAR

Perform Final Deliberation

Decide:

For Background Investigation → Yes / No

Finalize application decision

Record Date of Final Deliberation

Lock records after final decision

🔐 System Rules & Constraints

Enforce one-way process flow (no backward editing)

Only HR can access IER & IES modules

Only ASDS can finalize CAR

Applicant_Code must be unique and immutable

All computed fields must be calculated server-side

Include basic input validation and error handling

📊 Additional Features

Dashboard views per role

Status indicators (Submitted, Qualified, Disqualified, Under Assessment, Finalized)

File preview/download for admins

Clean and simple UI suitable for government use

📌 Output Expectation

Fully working CRUD-based web app

Well-structured folders (routes, models, controllers)

SQL schema initialization script

Clear comments explaining workflow logic
